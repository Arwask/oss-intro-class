# Contributing

## Bug reports

If you'd like to contribute, bug reports are awesome! Please include what
versions of node and npm, what version of the library, an example (can be
copied from your code), and some context (what are you trying to do). Also
crucial, post a stack trace.  Try to make sure the code you copy/paste actually
ends up formatted in the github UI. A blob of uncolored, unformatted text sucks
to read.

## Docs

Nobody likes writing docs except for that one person that does. We're not that
person. We'd be happy for people to submit PR's contributing to the
documentation with useful examples and gotchas, or to clean out obsolete docs.
(Inaccurate docs are ofter worse than no docs.)

## Tests

We try to be pretty stringent about testing, so any PR's must be accompanied by
passing tests excersizing the new code you wrote. Check out the `tests` dir to
get a feel for how we organize them.

## Style

Camel case, ES6 is cool, name your functions when possible (makes reading
traces easier). Be cool and respect the style of the existing code base. Don't
make noisy diffs.

## Check the Issues first

Someone may already be working on what you want to fix.
