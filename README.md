# Calculator
An example open source project that implements calculator functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in different
languages.

## Usage
Each langague is located in it's own folder. Right now we support these languages:

* Python - [Python folder](python)
* Node.js - [Node folder](node)

Each language should implement a calculator that can `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.

For installation and testing instructions, see the README in each language folder.

## OSS Intro Class
### Goals
Students should feel comfortable and confident making small contributions to open source projects. This includes
identifying issues, not doing work on issues that have already been claimed, participate in project chat channels (Slack, gitter, Discord, etc.), and filing pull requests with tests, and any necessary documentation updates.

### Outcomes
Students should be able to
* find a project they are interested in
* find issues they can tackle, communicate their interest, and file a pull request that solves the issue
* file an effective bug report
* understand what makes a good commit message
* these people make it all for free, so be patient and appreciate the work
